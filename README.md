# Pl3xScanner
Scans through [Pl3xMap](https://github.com/granny/Pl3xMap) surface as efficient as possible.<br>
It currently works on RivalsNetwork, but it's very easy to change to work on other servers too.

## How to run?
  1. Clone this repo and use ``gradlew shadowJar`` or grab the jar from the releases.
  2. Run the jar. ``java -jar thejarfile.jar``
  3. It will create a config file with the name: ``config.rivals``.
  4. Configure it. Everything described in it.
  5. Run the jar again.
  6. It's going to work if it's not then make an issue in this repo, thanks.
  7. The result will be in ``shulkers_kingdomsid.txt``.
  8. The result will be a xaero map waypoint list that you can import, so it makes the shulker hunting much easier.
  9. Thank you for running my rat. This rat is fitter than ever now.
